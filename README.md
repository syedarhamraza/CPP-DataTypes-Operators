In C++, operators and data types are essential building blocks for performing operations and storing values. Here’s a comprehensive list of **operators** and **data types** in C++.

### **C++ Data Types**

1.  **Primitive Data Types:**
    
    *   **Integer Types:**
        
        *   int: A standard integer (e.g., 10, -5)
            
        *   short: Smaller integer (typically 2 bytes)
            
        *   long: Larger integer (typically 4 bytes)
            
        *   long long: Even larger integer (typically 8 bytes)
            
    *   **Floating-Point Types:**
        
        *   float: Single precision floating-point (typically 4 bytes, e.g., 3.14)
            
        *   double: Double precision floating-point (typically 8 bytes, e.g., 3.14159)
            
        *   long double: Extended precision floating-point (typically 12-16 bytes)
            
    *   **Character Types:**
        
        *   char: A single character (e.g., 'A', 'b') – 1 byte
            
        *   wchar\_t: A wide character type (e.g., L'A') – 2 or 4 bytes, depending on the platform
            
    *   **Boolean Type:**
        
        *   bool: Stores true or false (typically 1 byte)
            
    *   **Void Type:**
        
        *   void: Represents no value or return type in functions that do not return a value
            
2.  **Derived Data Types:**
    
    *   **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type.
        
    *   **Pointer**: A variable that holds the address of another variable.
        
    *   **Reference**: An alias for another variable.
        
    *   **Function**: A block of code that performs a specific task.
        
3.  **User-defined Data Types:**
    
    *   **Struct**: A collection of different types under a single name.
        
    *   **Union**: A special data type where all members share the same memory location.
        
    *   **Enum**: A user-defined data type consisting of named integer constants.
        
    *   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (encapsulating data and functions).
        

### **C++ Operators**

1.  **Arithmetic Operators:**
    
    *   +: Addition
        
    *   \-: Subtraction
        
    *   \*: Multiplication
        
    *   /: Division
        
    *   %: Modulus (remainder)
        
2.  **Relational (Comparison) Operators:**
    
    *   \==: Equal to
        
    *   !=: Not equal to
        
    *   <: Less than
        
    *   \>: Greater than
        
    *   <=: Less than or equal to
        
    *   \>=: Greater than or equal to
        
3.  **Logical Operators:**
    
    *   &&: Logical AND
        
    *   ||: Logical OR
        
    *   !: Logical NOT

    *   &: Bitwise AND
        
    *   |: Bitwise OR
        
    *   ^: Bitwise XOR
        
    *   ~: Bitwise NOT
        
    *   <<: Left shift
        
    *   \>>: Right shift
        
5.  **Assignment Operators:**
    
    *   \=: Assignment
        
    *   +=: Add and assign
        
    *   \-=: Subtract and assign
        
    *   \*=: Multiply and assign
        
    *   /=: Divide and assign
        
    *   %=: Modulus and assign
        
6.  **Increment/Decrement Operators:**
    
    *   ++: Increment (increases the value by 1)
        
    *   \--: Decrement (decreases the value by 1)
        
7.  **Conditional (Ternary) Operator:**
    
    *   ?:: Conditional operator (e.g., condition ? value\_if\_true : value\_if\_false)
        
8.  **Comma Operator:**
    
    *   ,: Allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement (e.g., a = (b = 2, b + 1))
        
9.  **Type-Casting Operators:**
    
    *   static\_cast<>: Explicit type conversion
        
    *   dynamic\_cast<>: Used for safe downcasting in inheritance hierarchies
        
    *   const\_cast<>: Adds or removes const qualifier
        
    *   reinterpret\_cast<>: Low-level type conversion
        
10.  **Pointer Operators:**
    
    *   &: Address-of operator (gives the memory address of a variable)
        
    *   \*: Dereference operator (accesses the value stored at the pointer)
        
11.  **Scope Resolution Operator:**
    
    *   ::: Accesses global variables or functions when there’s a local variable or function with the same name.
        
12.  **Sizeof Operator:**
    
    *   sizeof: Returns the size of a variable or data type in bytes.
        
13.  **Member Access Operators:**
    
    *   .: Used to access members of an object or structure (e.g., object.member)
        
    *   \->: Used to access members through a pointer to an object (e.g., ptr->member)
        
14.  **New and Delete Operators:**
    
    *   new: Allocates memory on the heap for a variable or array
        
    *   delete: Frees the memory allocated by new
        
15.  **Exception Handling Operators:**
    
    *   try, catch, throw: Used for handling exceptions (errors)
        
16.  **Typeid Operator:**
    
    *   typeid: Used to get the type information of an expression (often used with RTTI).
        

### **Precedence and Associativity of Operators**

The precedence and associativity determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. For example, the \* and / operators have higher precedence than + and -, and the operators ++, --, !, and - are evaluated before others.
